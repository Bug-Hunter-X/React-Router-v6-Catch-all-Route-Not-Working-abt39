# React Router v6 Catch-all Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`path="*"`) in React Router v6. The catch-all route, intended to handle unmatched paths, is not functioning correctly.  The problem arises from incorrect placement or interaction with other routes.

## Problem Description:
The provided code uses React Router v6. The catch-all route, despite its proper syntax, fails to intercept unmatched routes, resulting in unexpected behavior. Instead of displaying the 'Not Found' component for any invalid path, the application might crash, display a blank screen, or render a different component incorrectly.

## Solution:
The solution involves ensuring the catch-all route is positioned correctly within the `<Routes>` component. It should be the last route declared to guarantee it handles any remaining paths.  If other routes conflict with its catch-all behavior (e.g., overlapping routes), those issues need to be resolved first.
